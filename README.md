## 🌈 Toggle Dark/Light Mode

Here is a button to toggle between dark and light modes. This functionality is implemented using JavaScript and CSS. Simply click the button below to change the theme.

```html
<!-- Button for theme toggle -->
<button onclick="toggleTheme()" style="padding: 10px; background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; border: none; cursor: pointer; border-radius: 5px;">
  Toggle Dark/Light Mode
</button>

<script>
  function toggleTheme() {
    const body = document.body;
    body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
    // Save the theme preference to local storage
    if (body.classList.contains('dark-mode')) {
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
    } else {
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light');
    }
  }

  // Check local storage for theme preference
  window.onload = () => {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
    if (savedTheme === 'dark') {
      document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');
    }
  };
</script>

<!-- CSS for Dark Mode -->
<style>
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
    transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;
